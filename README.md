# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

Problem:

X Education, an online course provider, attracts many potential leads through its website and marketing efforts. However, only 30% of leads convert into customers. The company wants to improve this by identifying "Hot Leads"—those most likely to convert—so the sales team can focus their efforts more efficiently.

Dataset:

You have a dataset of 9,000 leads, including information like:

Lead Source

Time Spent on Website

Visits

Last Activity

The target variable is Converted (1 for converted, 0 for not). Some categorical variables have a "Select" value, which should be treated as null.


Goal:

Build a Logistic Regression model to score leads from 0 to 100 based on their likelihood to convert. 
The model should help the company focus on high-potential leads and adapt to future changes in their lead conversion process.
